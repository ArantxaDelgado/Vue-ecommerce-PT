# Technical Test - Vue Frontend Developer

## Overview

Create a (fake) ecommerce web application.

You can use any library you may see fit but you must justify why.

You can use `https://dummyjson.com/` or similar to fake api responses.

You don't need to publish the site. Once done, just share the project with us.

## Requirements

### List

As a user I want to see a list of products.

As a user I want to see at least the name and price of each product.

As a user I want to filter the list of products by name.

As a user when I click on a list item I want to see its detailed information.

### Details

As a user I want to buy a product adding it to a cart.

### Authentication

As an unauthenticated user the first screen I see is a login form.

As an unauthenticated user I must login with a mail/password combination.

As an unauthenticated user I cannot see any other routes but the login form.

As an authenticated user I must be able to log out.

## Notes

We are more interested in good coding practices and your knowledge of the browser environment than in the whole fulfillment of the requirements.
